COMSW3134: Data Structures & Algorithms, Final Project
Dr. Brian Borowski (Fall 2024)

*Note: BST, RBT, Hash, and MyMap classes were course-provided; this class implements the program architecture, replacement logic, and optimization.

A modular command-line tool that performs global search-and-replace on large text files using replacement rules stored in a map. The program supports three backend data structures, Binary Search Tree, Red Black Tree, and Hash Table, all implementing a shared 'MyMap' interface. 

This project emphasizes algorithmic design, accuracy under transitive dependencies, and efficient processing of large inputs.
Features: cycle detection in replacement rules (union-find style cycle detection to prevent invalid replacement graphs), path compression optimization, robust input validation and error handling, and efficient large-file processing.
